1. 170 Million linked in usa profile data is used to train the model.
2. Preprocessing involves the emojis, Stop-Words, non english titles and duplicates removal.
3. After preprocessing by choosing a threshold value of 500, approximate 100k unique raw titles were obtained.
4. On these 100k raw titles manual output labelling is done which gives us approximate 60k standard titles.
5. Facebook bart large model is trained on these 100k dataset and the loss value was around 0.02.
6. Streamlit and postman api is developed in which the input is raw title and output is standard    title

## Input
- Raw text job title

## Output
- Standard job title
